#### Year 2 Concepts
The Year 2 Concepts I used were:
* GUI
* Multidimensional arrays
* Enhanced For loops
* Collections (ArrayList)

I also used one ternary statement, and implemented Mouse listeners.

#### Future Updates
* One feature I want to incorporate is the ability for the user to save their assignments.
* Settings for the user to decide how they want to organize the assignments would also be useful.
* I also wanted to color code the assignments based on status.

## TicTacToe Game

[Link to TicTacToe Repository](https://github.com/aaWang27/TicTacToeGame)

#### Description

This project implements the game of TicTacToe in a graphical user interface, allowing the user to play on the computer. The players click on the square that they want to occupy, and can also restart the game at any time by clicking on the Restart button. After the game is over, the winning player (or Tie) is displayed on the screen.

## Calculator

[Link to Calculator Repository](https://github.com/aaWang27/Calculator)

#### Description

This project is a simple calculator that allows for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The user can clear the display, and also use decimal points. If there is already one decimal point in the display, the calculator will prevent the user from adding another one. (e.g., 1.23 is acceptable, but the calculator will prevent 1.23.45) There is currently a rounding error in certain situations.
