### Year 2 Concepts
The Year 2 Concepts I used were:
* GUI
* Multidimensional arrays
* Enhanced For loops
* Collections (ArrayList)

I also used one ternary statement, and implemented Mouse listeners.

### Future Updates
* One feature I want to incorporate is the ability for the user to save their assignments.
* Settings for the user to decide how they want to organize the assignments would also be useful.
* I also wanted to color code the assignments based on status.
