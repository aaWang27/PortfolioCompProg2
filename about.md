# About Me

I am currently a sophomore at Skyline High School in Salt Lake City, Utah. I enjoy mathematics, successfully competing in competitions such as Mathcounts and the AMC. I also enjoy computer programming, and have participated in coding competitions. In my free time, I enjoy reading fantasy and mystery books, as well as biographies.
